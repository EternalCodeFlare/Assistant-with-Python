# Assistant_with_simple_Python

### This repository contains code for developing a voice assistant with Python using some libraries.

The libraries used in this are web based so ensure that you have a good internet connection and also please have a little patience while my little bot processes your speech. The libraries that are used in this small code can be installed freely using the following commands in your command prompt:

1. pip install library_name
2. conda install library_name  (In case that you are using the Anaconda environment just like I am in love with Jupyter Notebooks)
